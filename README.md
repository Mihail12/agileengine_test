Hello, thank you for the task it was really pleasure to do it. It is both interesting and challenging  
I have spend for it about 3 hours for it  
I also have used BeautifulSoup to get path to the tag to show an answer and i do not use it for finding sample button  
Hope it would okay  

So to start you should:
--
install python 3.6+

than:  
`pip install beautifulsoup4`

ant then start the script:

`python find_button_in_a_sample.py path/to/origin/html path/to/sample.html`

For Example:  
`python find_button_in_a_sample.py ./startbootstrap-sb-admin-2-examples/sample-0-origin.html ./startbootstrap-sb-admin-2-examples/sample-3-the-escape.html`
